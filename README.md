# mlUsingJS

Used lodash methods to implement Linear Regression
and then used tensorflow.js to implement the same
code which made things more efficient and simpler.

Worked on custom csv loader for implementing Logistic
Regression. 
Used different loss functions such as Mean Squared Error
and cross entropy loss. Applied different functions such
as sigmoid and softmax using tensorflow.js
